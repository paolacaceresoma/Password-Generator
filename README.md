# Password-Generator
Create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords.
## Description
The practical application of this password generator showcases the usefulness of JavaScript. For this assignment, I was tasked with writing JavaScript code that generates a random password based on the user's selected criteria. When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are prompted with alert boxes to specify the number of characters they want in their password and which types of characters they want to include, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
## Installation
No installation is necessary for this live website to function.
## Credits
In this assignment, I received the HTML and CSS files and some of the JS code. The function that prints the generated password on the screen was already implemented. However, I was tasked with writing the actual function to generate the password.
